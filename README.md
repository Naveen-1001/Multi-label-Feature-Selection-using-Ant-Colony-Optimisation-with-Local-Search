## Multi-label Feature Selection using Ant Colony Optimisation with Local Search

We propose a method of feature selection based on heuristic swarm intelligence. Since feature selection is a combinatorial NP- hard problem, a heuristic algorithm like ant colony optimisation can be used to approximate a good enough solution set. Standard ACO combined with redundancy and relevancy values is used to generate a solution set. 
This solution is further improved using random restructure local search that it makes use of multiple classifiers to remove inherent bias. 

The proposed approach is evaluated on three different multi-label datasets and compared with existing works. The experimental results clearly show that
the proposed approach outperforms the existing multi-label feature selection techniques.
